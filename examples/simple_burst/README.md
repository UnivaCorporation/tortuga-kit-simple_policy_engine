Simple Policy Engine README
===========================

Best Practices
--------------

It is recommended to make a copy of these rules/policies and modify the copy
for your needs. The example rules are subject to change/improvement. End-user
patching of the sample rules and/or scripts may be prone to breakage.

### Univa Grid Engine specifics

The Univa Grid Engine root directory (defined in the environment variable
`SGE_ROOT`), may need to be adjusted in the example Simple Policy Engine
rules/scripts based on the version of UGE installed.

Example rules/scripts will be suitable for use with the latest version of Grid
Engine, however for sites not using the latest version of Grid Engine, the UGE
root path contained within rules/scripts will need to be modified.
